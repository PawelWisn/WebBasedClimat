        <dl>
            <dt>Water vapor</dt>
            <dd style="font-size: 25px">- The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to
                the climate. Water vapor
                increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation,
                making these some of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.
            </dd>
            <dt>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</dt>
            <dd style="font-size: 15pt">- A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is
                released through natural
                processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation,
                land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by more
                than a third since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of
                climate change.
            </dd>
            <dt>Methane</dt>
            <dd style="font-size: 55%">- A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities,
                including the
                decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant
                digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock. On a molecule-for-molecule basis,
                methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less
                abundant in the atmosphere.
            </dd>
            <dt>Nitrous oxide</dt>
            <dd>- A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and
                organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.
            </dd>
            <dt>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</dt>
            <dd>- Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number of applications, but now largely
                regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to
                contribute to destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.

            <li class="list-group-item">A stronger greenhouse effect will warm the oceans and partially melt glaciers and other ice, increasing
                sea level. Ocean water also will expand if it warms, contributing further to sea level rise.

            <li class="list-group-item">Meanwhile, some crops and other plants may respond favorably to increased atmospheric CO2, growing more
                vigorously and using water more efficiently. At the same time, higher temperatures and shifting climate
                patterns may change the areas where crops grow best and affect the makeup of natural plant communities.

        <div>
            <p>In its Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300
                independent
                scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded
                there's a more than 95 percent probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our
                planet. The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric
                carbon
                dioxide levels from 280 parts per million to 400 parts per million in the last 150 years. The panel also
                concluded there's a better than 95 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases such as
                carbon
                dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have caused much of the observed increase in Earth's temperatures
                over
                the past 50 years. The panel's full Summary for Policymakers report is online at <a
